# Introduction

## Original Data


- Complete edit history of all Wikipedia (2001-2008).

- Original zip file > 18 GB, unzipped raw data file > 291 GB. 

![](http://blogs.tigarus.com/patcoola/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/GBInternet2013.gif)


## Our project

Using Wikipedia edit history, our interest was:

- Edit Wars?
- How we found them?
- A closer look into the articles for <u>Barnard's Star</u> and <u>Condoms</u>.


# What are "Edit Wars", and how to find them?

## Process Flow

<img src="Diagram.png" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;">

## Raw Data - Munging

```{r raw data}
cat(raw.txt)
```

## First look at the structured data

```{r}
cat(output.txt)
```


## What does 291 GBs of data give us?

* 2,953,385 Unique Articles
    <br>
* 116,590,855 Edits

## All articles: *What does it look like?*

```{r}
pandoc.table(head(inital_output_example), justify = 'right')
```

As you can see, looks pretty ungly...

## Top 10 overall edited

```{r}
pandoc.table(top_most_edited, justify = 'right')
```


## Superset: Making sense of the data!

Getting a list of articles edited by date:

```{r}
pandoc.table(head(top1000_revisions_in_a_day[,1:3], 6), justify = 'right')
```

## Datasets

- *Superset*
    * A list of every article's date and number of edits for that date.
    
    <br>
    
- *Outliers*
    * The mean number of edits per day for each article (top 5\%).
    
    <br>

- *Random*
    * Excluding the previous 67 articles, we radomly picked another 67 articles.

## Data Structure and fields we used

<ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li> `REVISION` ***</li>

# Finally   manageable   dataset!       Now what?

## Number of comments and unique users

- Take a look at the data
- Assumptions
- Goals

## Top 10 Edits:

## Our goals where - 

  <br>

## What triggered the mass edits?


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard%27s_Star" data-preview-link>Barnard's Star</a>

Barnard’s Star was the wikipedia “article of the day” when it saw its spike in edits. We attribute the spike in edits to be due to the people “trolling” this article due to its unexpected exposure as being selected as the article of the day on October 18, 2007.

# Condom

## What triggered the mass edits?


<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condom" data-preview-link>Condom</a>

On December 25, 2005, the Catholic Church released a statement stating that “Safe sex” in regards to sexual activity using condoms is not actually safe.  The condom article saw its spike in edits on December 26, 2005 - one day after this released statement. 

[Statement](https://catholicnews.sg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=709:e2809csafe-sexe2809d-is-not-really-safe&catid=140:december-2005&Itemid=473&lang=en)
